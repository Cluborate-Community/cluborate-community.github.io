EVE looks to support other organizations through financial resources and other forms of support, so they, too, can get
closer to their feminist-aligned goals. In a society where power - which is often correlated with money - is taught to
be finite and zero-sum, we want to teach future generations otherwise. Today, there is an ever growing demand for
education on social change and opportunities for future world leaders, and we hope to fulfill this through our unique
programs, products, and chapter system.
