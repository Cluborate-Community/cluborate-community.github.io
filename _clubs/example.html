    Kurius -- we believe in something different: that anyone and everyone can create technology with the potential to change the world.
description: >
    Kurius is a Canadian-based youth nonprofit aiming to empower students through code! We host multiple workshops each month on all sorts of fascinating topics (from basic Java to AI and Discord bot building) as well as several large-scale events each year. Our most notable events include our biannual hackathons (KuriusHacks: SE & CE) and our month-long Learnathon in June. Although we primarily serve Canadians students, we welcome learners from all over the world, whether in high school, CEGEP or any undergraduate program. So feel free to drop on by and, most of all, remember to stay Kurius!
