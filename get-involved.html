                As a registered chapter under CLUBORATE, Club Coalitions are aligned with Cluborate's core mission to
                inspire passionate community youth leaders willing to lead the charge in exposing other youth to more
                opportunities for leadership, development, and growth, all in benefit of the local community.

                <p>
                    The objective of this plan is to engage awareness and impact of the Cluborate community into a wider
                    range of school communities across Canada and the world. While price is a significant factor in
                    marketing, promotion, and chapter funding, increased engagement is a critical factor for expansion.
